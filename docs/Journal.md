# Journal

This document is my journal about this project. I am writing all my thoughts trials and errors. This is my way of thinking process. My mind is open-soured in a way. Please note that I am writing this document very fast and there may be too many typos like tis one.

- Heyoo! Repo is being created. Waw I've missed this. I wasn't doing that for a long time. Now here we are.
- So first I need to figure it out what output am I going to accomplish with this project?
  - Well I think I need a game environment.
  - I need the list of words? How can find them? Maybe downbload from a online public dictionary. Also I need the list of letters :D Sorry it is going to be in turkish. I want my doughter to be able to play this game. Too a look to [this](https://sozluk.gov.tr)
  - Should I seperate the API from interface? It would be very flexiable.
  - Ok and the hot part. What the AI is going to do exactlly?
    - Well can it guess the probabilty of the next letter? Maybe this is a good posibility to experiment how this NLP thing works out huh?
    - On the other hand that may be is a little bit overkill. Since the pattern that had arrised with the experience with my doughter is first call the vowels and then call any other consonant letter. The key point to not to hang the man of course we are continouslly skimming our words in our memory if it matches with the state of the board. That would be mercilessly give competitive advantage to this agent of course. You oow computers have a far more better way to manage memory than human's (well at least most of the humans).
    - May be I can create two different agents and compare their avarage guessed letters for each game. I do not have to put kill/end of the game (I may never hang the man) or I will define a parameter that at which guess the man will be hanged. If I assign the number of the letters in a alphabet then technically it would be imposible to loose ther game.
    - Should I measurre the game win and loose? I am not sure yet.
- I need to put these thoughts to in order and convert into cards. [Here](https://github.com/hakanonal/hang-man-ai/projects/1) it is.

- I am looking how can I find the list of all words? There many applications but I need the raw data. Here is the [card](https://github.com/hakanonal/hang-man-ai/projects/1#card-65714026)
